# Scenario (4/6)
## Status

Approved

## Context

We need a service that will provide analytics on our app, like tracking product views, purchases, etc.

## Decision

We will be using Firebase Analytics. It is compatible with React Native: "npm i @react-native-firebase/analytics" 

## Consequences

Firebase has a free plan that we can use to test the water. If all goes well, we can start paying for it.
