## Status

Approved. 

## Context

We need a localization framework. 

## Decision

We will use Google Translate's API. It is also compatible with React Native: "npm i translate-google-api". 

## Consequences

The cost of using Google Translate is that we will have to pay 20$ for 500,000 to 1B characters translated per month. Lower values will be free.
